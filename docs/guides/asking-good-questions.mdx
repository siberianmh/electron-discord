---

This document is intended to provide you with the infromation to get help
effectively.

## Before You Ask

Before you ask your question, there are a few things you can do to find an
answer on your own. Experienced developers will do the following:

- Read the official Electron documentation or whatever you're working with.
- Use a debugger to inspect your code.
- Do some research online - for example, on Stack Overflow or issues.

## A Good Question

When you're ready to ask a question a few things you should have to hand before
forming a query:

- A code example that illustates your problem
- If possbile, make this a minimal example, better
  [Fiddle](https://electronjs.org/fiddle)
- Full version information - for example "Electron v11.0.1 on Windows 10 2004"

## What Not To Ask

### Can I ask a question?

Yes. Just ask it.

### My code doesn't work

This isn't a question, and it provides absolute no context or information. Don't
be offended by this - just try again with a better question.
